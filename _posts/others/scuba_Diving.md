Scuba Diving
-----------

An interesting thing that I did recently was scuba diving. I tried it when I went on vacation to Thailand this summer and I really enjoyed it. I  did a controlled dive with an instructor and I dived to 6m. I had butterflies in my stomach at first but it all went away when I dived into the water. I  saw many different kinds of fish and coral because it was sunny that day so the water was really clear. After seeing the underwater scenery, all my nervousness was gone and it felt like I went into another world. It was an experience that was pretty unique because I’ve never done anything like it. My first dive was one hour including basic training. I felt that one hour wasn’t enough because I got hooked on it. They told me that if I really like this sport I can do a course to get an open water certificate, it’s like a 3 day course so I decided to participate in the course. Overall it was a great experience, I spent like 5 days scuba diving in Thailand. It cost me a lot  of money but it was really enjoyable and it was worth it.
